# Alura Challenge: Programming Challenge

This project is part of the Alura programming challenge. The task was to build a simple "encryption tool" using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The design was open to creativity. I chose to simulate a Linux operating system environment, specifically the Kali distribution. This approach reflects a unique and functional aesthetic while keeping the tool simple and user-friendly.

## Key features

* Encryption: Replace vowels in the text with predefined strings.
* Decryption: Reverse the encryption to restore the original text.
* User Interface: Simple and functional design using HTML and CSS.

## Additional Features

- Homepage: Includes an explanation of how the tool works, with a "Try App" button that takes you to the encryption tool simulating the Kali Linux environment.
- Responsive Design: The tool is designed to work well on various screen sizes.
